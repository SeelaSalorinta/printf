🖨️ ft_printf

For my second project at Hive Helsinki, I built my own version of printf! 🛠️ The goal was to recreate its functionality from scratch, handling the following conversions: c, s, p, d, i, u, x, X, and %.

Of course, no project is complete without a header file and a Makefile to keep things organized. 📂 It was a challenging but super fun project, and it definitely leveled up my understanding of formatted output in C!

✨ On to the next adventure!
